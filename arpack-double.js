// 3. pre-run appended it, var Module = {}; ..generated code..
// 4. External script tag defines var Module.

// case, where this code here is minified but Module was defined
// elsewhere (e.g. case 4 above). We also need to check if Module
// already exists (e.g. case 3 above).
// Note that if you want to run closure, and also to use Module
// after the generated code, you will need to define   var Module = {};
// before the code. Then that object will be used in the code, and you
// can continue to use Module afterwards as well.

   * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.
   * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE
   * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as
   * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this
