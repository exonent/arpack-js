A JavaScript port of ARPACK.  Seriously!
=========================================

(Sung to the tune of "Our House" by Madness)

Your eigenvectors are a mess...
Power method won't do the trick
The spectral norm has made you sick.

Javascript just makes things worse...
Arnoldi cannnot save your skin
You're doomed to implode.

ARPACK...in the middle of our 'Script
ARPACK...in the middle of our...

But you're in luck my friend...
For f2c will save the day
and squish your Fortran into C.

LLVM will munch that C...
Creating little object files
Emscripten joins and stayes a while.

ARPACK...in the middle of our...
ARPACK...in the middle of our 'Script
ARPACK...in the middle of our...
(Something tells you that performance will be poor!)

You cleave the Makefiles like a pro...
Devoting hours of precious labor
Chaining toolchains unsafely together.

Then the build is finally sane...
You press the button gingerly
"Ahoy! We're done!" says EMCC.

ARPACK...in the middle of our...

Now you've got your JavaScript
There's something good inside of it
But you now have to use it somehow,
Such a headache,
Such a heartache,
You poke and prod the API
Flail at straws and gouge your eyes
Then you find
That malloc segfaults your program...
...go figure.

JavaScript you've been a friend...
You run this ancient algorithm
Even slower than it was then.
But now at least we've got a way...
To get those eigenvectors
And flaunt them around.

ARPACK...in the middle of our 'Script
ARPACK...in the middle of our 'Script
ARPACK...in the middle of our...
  ARPACK...is our Krylov fricassee
ARPACK...in the middle of our 'Script
  ARPACK...Rayleigh-Ritz and Arnoldi!
